//excellent solution// just Copy the next node to given node and then we can delete the next node easily.

class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        node->val = node->next->val; //copying the next node value
        node->next = node->next->next; // deleting the next node
    }
};
